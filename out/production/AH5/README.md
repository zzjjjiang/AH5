# Algo Hour 5

## Objectives

Write a function, mostFrequentChar, that takes in a string as an argument. 
The function should return the most frequent character of the string. If there are ties, 
the character that appears earlier in the string. You can assume that the input string is non-empty.

## Test Cases

```java
System.out.println(Source.mostFrequentChar("bookeeper")); // -> 'e'
```

```java
System.out.println(Source.mostFrequentChar("david")); // -> 'd'
```

```java
System.out.println(Source.mostFrequentChar("mississippi")); // -> 'i'
```

```java
System.out.println(Source.mostFrequentChar("eleventennine")); // -> 'e'
```
